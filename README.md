# Pixelate

Pixelate is a project created to explore, experiment, and learn about the graphics pipeline. It focuses on implementing various graphics techniques and features from scratch using modern OpenGL.

## Features

- Basic rendering of geometric primitives
- Basic lighting implementation
- Texture mapping
- FPS camera controller for navigating the scene

## Motivation

The primary goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of how computer graphics rendering works at a fundamental level. By implementing each feature manually, The aim is to grasp the underlying concepts of the graphics pipeline, including vertex processing, rasterization, fragment processing, and more.
